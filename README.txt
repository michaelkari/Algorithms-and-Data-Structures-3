Michael Karimizadeh Lab3 Summary
My lab does not fucntion correctly as I did not have permission to run the "Makefile" executable given
in the lab. If I were to complete the lab at school in an open lab, I might have been able to run the file
and complete the lab. Due to a blizzard, this seems to be an unattainable scenario.

Analysis of Algorithms:
Best case sorting - all elements already sorted
Worst case sorting - all elements reverse sorted

Insertion Sort:
Best case sort occurs in a data set such as 1,2,3,4,5 which results in 0 swaps, 4 comparisons, and 5 copies.
Time complexity is Omega(n) for best case. Worst case occurs in a data set such as 5,4,3,2,1 which results
in 10 swaps, 10 comparisins, and 5 copies. Time complexity is O(n^2) for worst case. Average case sort
occurs in a data set such as 1,3,2,5,4 and results in 2 swaps, 6 comparisons, and 5 copies. Time complexity
is in between Omega (n) and O(n^2).

Merge Sort:
Best case sort occurs in a data set such as 1,2,3,4,5 which results in 12 swaps, 7 comparisons, and 5 copies.
Worst case occurs in a data set such as 5,4,3,2,1 which results in 12 swaps, 5 comparisins, and 7 copies.
Average case sort occurs in a data set such as 1,3,2,5,4 and results in 12 swaps, 7 comparisons, and 5 copies. 
The time complexity of merge sort remains the same in all cases. ie// O(n*log(n)).
